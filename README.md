<ul>
<li>I have created JSON data(stored in 'Public' ) as of myself for this project. On the go through of my journey, I used plain CSS as well as Bootstrap. I also extended my dependencies for the smooth go of this project.</li>
<li> I used 10 components (About,Doctors,Footer,Blogs,Header,Home,NotFound,Service,Services,Review ) with yarn installation.</li>
<li>I had to go for React Router Dom for making Routes on the go of this project.</li>
<li>Context API, Font awesome & private route were used for the project.</li>

</li>
</ul>
